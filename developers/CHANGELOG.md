## 1.1.0 @25.Mar.2017

Upgraded to include new changes from Genesis Sample version 2.3.0 including:

- WooCommerce module

## 1.0.3 @17.Feb.2017

Changed the `setup_child_theme()` callback priority number to 15 to ensure that Genesis' setups run first before the child theme.

## 1.0.2 @17.Oct.2016

- Fixed path for enqueuing `/assets/js/responsive-menu.js`

## 1.0.1

Changed autoload.php to move Customizer loading into the nonadmin files.  Why?  The customizer action occurs before `admin_init`.  It wants to be loaded at the start independent of the admin area.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
