# Let’s Build a Custom Developer’s Genesis Starter Child Theme Lab

Lab Date: March 25, 2017

This [hands-on coding lab](https://knowthecode.io/series/lets-build-custom-developers-genesis-starter-child-theme) walks you through the entire process of converting a standard Genesis theme into a developer-friendly, modular theme.  The purpose of this lab is to teach you about the following:

1. Techniques to save you time and time as you are building your own workflow and starter theme
2. Modularity for PHP and CSS
3. How to break up your code to be more readable, reusable, and thus, more maintainable.
4. How to convert a `style.css` file into a Sass module
5. How to setup Gulp as your task runner to process the Sass into `style.css` and a minified version `style.min.css`
6. How to build your own modern workflow with Composer, Sass, Gulp, Bourbon, and Neat.

## What's in this repository?

There are 2 separate themes in this repository:

1. Version 2.3.0 of the Genesis Sample Theme
2. The final Developers Starter Child Theme - it's the final version that you will build in this lab

## How about the new version of the Sample Theme?

Late in 2016, StudioPress upgraded the Sample theme to include a WooCommerce module.  Once you complete this lab, you will be able to add the new updates to your Developers theme by yourself.

## Dependencies

This child theme requires the following dependencies:

- [Genesis framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/)

## Installation

To install this repository, do the following:

1. Open up terminal and navigate to the `wp-content/themes` folder.
2. Then type: git clone [git@github.com:KnowTheCode/Genesis-Developer-Starter-Lab.git](git@github.com:KnowTheCode/Genesis-Developer-Starter-Lab.git)
3. Then move both themes out of the new folder and into the root of the `wp-content/themes` folder.
4. You can then delete the new folder, as it's not needed any longer.

You will use the Genesis Sample theme in this repository for the lab.
